## What is Patternodes?

Patternodes is a professional-grade application for designers and artists who want to explore the power of procedural and parametric design. It moves beyond traditional drawing tools by utilizing a visual, node-based interface where you construct your artwork as a diagram of interconnected nodes. Each node represents an operation, shape, or value, and their connections define the logic of the final graphic.

This methodology is ideal for generating intricate geometric patterns, detailed illustrations, repeating textures, and animated sequences with absolute precision. The real power lies in its non-destructive workflow; any element can be modified at any stage of the process, and the entire composition will adapt automatically. This makes it an exceptional tool for tasks requiring multiple variations or iterative design, such as branding assets, data visualization, textile patterns, and motion design.

Patternodes produces resolution-independent vector graphics, ensuring output is always sharp for both screen and print. It is developed specifically to leverage the full capabilities of the macOS platform, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.
